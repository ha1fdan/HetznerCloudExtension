# Hetzner Extensions for [paymenter.org](https://github.com/Paymenter/Paymenter)

This repository contains Hetzner extensions for Paymenter, offering two separate extensions for different Hetzner services:

## üì¶ Available Extensions (Paymenter v1.2)

### **hetznerCLOUD** - Cloud Servers Extension
Located in the `hetznerCLOUD/` folder, this extension allows Paymenter v1.2 to sell Hetzner Cloud servers. Built around the [api.hetzner.cloud](https://api.hetzner.cloud) API, it enables automated provisioning and management of cloud servers.

### **hetznerSTORAGE** - Storage Boxes Extension  
Located in the `hetznerSTORAGE/` folder, this extension allows Paymenter v1.2 to sell Hetzner Storage Boxes. Built around the [api.hetzner.com](https://api.hetzner.com) API, it enables automated provisioning and management of storage solutions.

## üîÑ Migration from v0.9

These new extensions are complete rewrites of the original Hetzner Cloud extension (now archived in the `archive/` folder) and are designed specifically for **Paymenter v1.2**. The old v0.9 extension in the archive folder is no longer maintained and only worked with Paymenter v0.9.x.

> **Note:** These extensions are designed for the newest version of Paymenter (v1.2) and replace the legacy v0.9 extension.

## üöÄ Features Overview

Both extensions provide comprehensive management capabilities for their respective Hetzner services, including automated provisioning, monitoring, and control features designed specifically for Paymenter v1.2.
